Thomas Kuhn's work "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions" discusses the
disruptive periods of innovation that break out amongst "normal" periods of
science.

- "Truth emerges more readily from error than from confusion.‚Äù
- "Unanticipated novelty, the new discovery, can emerge only to the extent that
  his anticipations about nature and his instruments prove wrong."
