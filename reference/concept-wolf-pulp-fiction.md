The character Winston Wolf from Pulp Fiction is an example of how you should act
as a professional. He gets straight to the problem and keeps focused on the
boundaries of the issue.

He doesn't rationalize, act confused, deliberate. He is decisive.

- "My name is Winston Wolf. I solve problems."

He first considers all elements and goals related to the issue. He asks
questions and fully understands the perspective of the customer.

- "Let's get down to brass tacks gentlemen."
- "I'm not here to say please, I'm here to tell you what to do."

Wears a suit and bowtie.
