## Lessons from the Trip

- Doing more research about places
  - Street view
  - Satellite

  - Ask other people in same situation that have been what they thought
    - “Don’t ask single people or people without kids when you have kids”
- Airbnb is mandatory for family if staying over 2 days
  - Laundry, space, food, etc.
- Booking in advance only makes sense if things will be fully booked
  - “Book as late as possible before things sell out or get more expensive”
