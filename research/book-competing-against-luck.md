# Competing Against Luck

## Summary

A breakdown of the mental model around "jobs to be done." A concept where you
think of businesses around the jobs they help people with, along with the
struggle and circumstances surrounding them.

## Jobs to be done

- The core idea behind what makes someone purchase a product is associated with
  the "job" you hire that product to do, the struggle and the circumstances
  surrounding it.
- [[quote-deming-ask-right-question]] Edwards Deming, "if you don't ask the
  right question, you discover nothing"
- The first step to understanding the framing of a product, is to understand the
  "struggle for progress" that a customer is making and the circumstances
  surrounding the struggle at the time of purchase

## Theory: Center of a business is the job your product does, not the customer

- The hallmark of a good theory distributes advice in if/then statements
- Anomalies should be embraced as an opportunity to strengthen a theory by
  explaining them where other theories do not
  - reference: copernicus
- Traditional theory centers on the customer or the persona, the jobs theory
  focuses on the product "job" instead.

## Lizard Brain and Circumstance

- To look for areas of product innovation, analyze the "job to be done" but with
  the lens of "lizard" brain motivations.
  - the emotional, psychological, physical, sexual, social, superstitious,
    greedy, voyeuristic, gamified, curious, fearful, anxious
  - people don't make decisions logically, rationally
- what signals do customers use to establish credibility?

## Compensating Measures

How do customers compensate with the current solution? Does the current solution
encompass the "whole" product?

- What are the obstacles that users face? What have they internalized as
  necessary?
- What exactly are they trying to make progress with? Using emotional terms.
- what are the circumstances in the moment a user is attempting to make
  progress?

## Obstacles

- What obstacles are getting in the way of a person making progress?
- Can you do anything to remove these obstacles?

## Non Consumers

Often no product serves the user in a satisfactory way, and these users choose
to go ahead without a solution.

These non-consumers can often be an untapped source of customers if a solution
is custom tailored to their needs and serves them better than other offerings.

## We Get You

- Everything you do in your product platform should signal that "we get you" to
  the customer. This can be done again by understanding the struggle.
- What are the social, functional, and emotional dimensions of the struggle and
  circumstance?

## perspective

- [[quotes-bezos-perspective]]

- Sony founder Akio Morita actually advised against market research, urging
  instead to â€œcarefully watch how people live, get an intuitive Sense of how
  they live and then go with it"
- When looking for jobs, it all depends on perspective. What you are looking for
  and how's you piece your observations together
- Look for negative jobs, things people want to avoid.
- Compensating behaviors are often the sign of a job and innovation opporunity,
  but you will only see them if you are immersed in context
- Why are users just not using something like a competitor? What is the problem
  with those solutions they makes them not want to use them?
- Innovators need to develop a heat-seaking sense for the anxiety, stress and
  struggle associated with change. E.g. hiring a new product or taking the first
  step to do so.
- What product or behavior will need to get fired for a new product to get
  hired? How happy is the user about firing this approach?
- Is the new product going to be good enough or distributed in a way that allows
  for transition?

## Innovation

- Innovation can be done by simply reducing "blocking forces"
- To innovate is 3 steps:
  - uncover the job to be done

## Experiences

- Products succeed based on experiences not features
- When planning a specification, ask: what do i need to do to create the "right"
  experiences and to solve this job well (relating to the struggle nad
  circumstance)
- "People don't buy a drill, they buy holes in the wall."
