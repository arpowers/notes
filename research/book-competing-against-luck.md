# Competing Against Luck

## Summary

A breakdown of the mental model around "jobs to be done." A concept where you
think of businesses around the jobs they help people with, along with the
struggle and circumstances surrounding them.

## Jobs to be done

- The core idea behind what makes someone purchase a product is associated with
  the "job" you hire that product to do, the struggle and the circumstances
  surrounding it.
- [[quote-deming-ask-right-question]] Edwards Deming, "if you don't ask the
  right question, you discover nothing"
- The first step to understanding the framing of a product, is to understand the
  "struggle for progress" that a customer is making and the circumstances
  surrounding the struggle at the time of purchase

## Theory: Center of a business is the job your product does, not the customer

- The hallmark of a good theory distributes advice in if/then statements
- Anomalies should be embraced as an opportunity to strengthen a theory by
  explaining them where other theories do not
  - reference: copernicus
- Traditional theory centers on the customer or the persona, the jobs theory
  focuses on the product "job" instead.

## Lizard Brain and Circumstance

- To look for areas of product innovation, analyze the "job to be done" but with
  the lens of "lizard" brain motivations.
  - the emotional, psychological, physical, sexual, social, superstitious,
    greedy, voyeuristic, gamified, curious, fearful, anxious
  - people don't make decisions logically, rationally
- what signals do customers use to establish credibility?

## Compensating Measures

How do customers compensate with the current solution? Does the current solution
encompass the "whole" product?

- What are the obstacles that users face? What have they internalized as
  necessary?
- What exactly are they trying to make progress with? Using emotional terms.
- what are the circumstances in the moment a user is attempting to make
  progress?

## Obstacles

- What obstacles are getting in the way of a person making progress?
- Can you do anything to remove these obstacles?

## Non Consumers

Often no product serves the user in a satisfactory way, and these users choose
to go ahead without a solution.

These non-consumers can often be an untapped source of customers if a solution
is custom tailored to their needs and serves them better than other offerings.

## We Get You

- Everything you do in your product platform should signal that "we get you" to
  the customer. This can be done again by understanding the struggle.
