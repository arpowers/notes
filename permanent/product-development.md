## Ideation

- If you can't see your users in their struggle and circumstances, then it is
  unlikely you will be able to accurately serve them with a great product

## Concepts for Product Development

- The focus of a new product should be on the job the product is hired to do
- The struggle of the customers is the focus on the job, and the circumstances
  of that struggle are the medium
- What are the barriers to progress that the customer has with the current
  solutions?
- Does the customer have a solution currently or are they a non-consumer? What
  would it take to make the customer fire their current solution?
- For non-consumers, why aren't they using a product for a specific job? in the
  case of facebook, the posts were sometimes damaging and problematic socially,
  Snapchat worked because of this
