## Developing Perspective

- Perspective is the primary means of creating a successful business.
- Most business ideas are bad, not because the founders are stupid, but because
  they have the wrong perspective
- People want to skip the steps that develop perspective. These steps often
  include working for someone else, doing things you don't want to do, doing
  things that "don't scale", etc.
- If you can't see your users in their struggle and circumstances, then it is
  unlikely you will be able to accurately serve them with a great product

## Misleading Signals

- If you can't see users in their struggle, then you will likely take
  information from confused sources
  - press and media discussing trends based on what will create readers instead
    of natural market dynamics
  - competitors with confused products and poor insights
  - funding and money raised from investors

## What is the correct perspective?

- In the beginning of a new business, you are unwelcome.
- New businesses must do two things in order to break through the line:
  - fill a gap that exists in the user's struggle
  - be implemented in a way in which the same users will pay multiple times in
    proportion to the size and profit in each sale
  - be implemented in a way that auto-markets so you can avoid the "paid
    marketing" trap

## How do you develop perspective?

- Businesses are typically created by either sales people or consultants because
  these jobs lend themselves to perspective
- understand what people are willing to pay for that doesn't yet exist
- getting actual money from people (for the right reasons) is the strongest
  signal of a potential business
- is the thing they are paying for scalable?
  - some things aren't scalable, design and marketing need a custom touch which
    makes them hard to scale
- perspective is related to timing, new changes and new types of companies have
  many problems without ideal solutions
- once industries have existed for a long time, often the low hanging fruit is
  off the trees.

## Reference

- Jung relates that perspective and pain are the same. [[jung-jung-growth-pain]]
