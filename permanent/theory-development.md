## Structure of a theory

- New and breakthrough innovations follow from anomalies
- The focus of research should be on uncovering anomalies and breaks with
  theories as opposed to confirming them

## Presentation of a theory

- good theories present themselves in if/then statements

## Private Realities

- There is a large amount of scientific fact that is not welcome in the public
  spectrum, not without reason: the public doesn't need to know every detail and
  the facts can often create more problems than they solve
- The facts that are unwelcome to the public are the reasons why a pure
  #democracy can't work
