In business, there are multiple types of data that are needed to innovate.

Once you're in production, there is an overwhelming amount of "active" data
generated from interactions and analytics. The problem with this type of
innovation is that it is linear and can easily mislead you in terms of
innovation.

In effect, active data helps you optimize something that you may not even need
to do.

Passive information, such as qualitative observation, is subtle and disruptive
in nature. Specifically _because_ it isn't generated actively.

Active data encourages mismatches also because certain things might work, even
if not optimized. Active data helps you find the "local maximum".
